In the above example, the test is set to run at 00:00, 00:15, 00:30, 00:45, 06:00, 06:15, 06:30, 06:45, 12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45, 18:00, 18:15, 18:30, and 18:45 every day of every month.

Note that free accounts cannot schedule runs more frequently than every 30 minutes. For this reason they can only set minutes to 15 and 45.

# Results
