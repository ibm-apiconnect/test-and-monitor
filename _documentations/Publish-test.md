After you have completed the configuration of your test, and run it manually to confirm that it works correctly, you can publish the test. You need to publish a test to be able to schedule it to run automatically.  
  
After you have published a test, you can continue to work on the test in the Composer without affecting the published test, and then publish the test again later to update the published test.  
  
To publish a test, complete the following steps:

1. Click your project name in the menu bar to get to the "Projects" page.

1. From the list of tests double-click the test that you want to publish, or click the **edit** icon ![Image of the edit this test icon](./dist/images/icon-edit-test.png) for the test. 

1. The status page for your test is displayed. If your test has not been published before, the status will show as **Not published**.
