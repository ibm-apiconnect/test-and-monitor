To delete a project, complete the following steps:  
  
{% include open_project_page.md %}
    
1. On the projects page, locate the project you want to delete and determine whether it contains any tests by observing the displayed **Tests** count.

    **Note:** You can't delete a project that contains tests, so if your project does contain any tests you must delete them first; see [Deleting a test](./delete-test).  
  
  
1. To delete the project, click its **Settings** icon ![Image of project settings icon](./dist/images/icon-settings.png), then click **Remove Project**  

    **Note:** If the project contains tests, you will get an error when you click the **Settings** icon.

    If your project is deleted successfully, you are returned to your test organization project page, and your deleted project is no longer displayed.
