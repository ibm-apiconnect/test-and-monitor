# Deleting a project

To delete a project, complete the following steps:  
  
1. Click your test organization name in the menu bar to open your test organization project page.

1. On the projects page, locate the project you want to delete and determine whether it contains any tests by observing the displayed **Tests** count.

    **Note:** You can't delete a project that contains tests, so if your project does contain any tests you must delete them first; see [Deleting a test](./delete-test).  
  
  
1. To delete the project, click its **Settings** icon ![Image of project settings icon](./dist/images/icon-settings.png), then click **Remove Project**  

    **Note:** If the project contains tests, you will get an error when you click the **Settings** icon.

    If your project is deleted successfully, you are returned to your test organization project page, and your deleted project is no longer displayed.
