We are just getting started, and as we are building out our project we also want to develop a community around it. We would love to hear directly from you. Praise or criticism. Questions or suggestions. We look forward to them all.

## How to reach us

### Want to chat?
If you are looking for a more interactive way to communicate with us, drop in to our [Slack channel](https://ibm-cloud-tech.slack.com/messages/microclimate) to ask questions, share ideas, or just hang out and chat about all things Microclimate. If you have not previously used the ibm-cloud-tech slack instance, [click here to request an invite](https://slack-invite-ibm-cloud-tech.mybluemix.net/).

### Find something that needs to be improved?
Have a recommendation on something we can do to improve the Microclimate experience? We've opened up shop on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/microclimate-dev2ops)!

If you spot a bug, or if something isn't quite working as you expect, you can open an issue [here](https://github.com/microclimate-dev2ops/microclimate-dev2ops.github.io/issues). Help us to help you!

### In search of some answers?
While we put a lot of effort into making Microclimate easy to use, we know there will always be questions. If you have something you need help with, post your question to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/microclimate) to leverage the minds and experiences of an army of developers...including ours!
