This GitHub repository contains two things :
1. Developer Hub code.
1. Desktop Application releases.

## The Developer Hub

This is where you'll find documentation for IBM API Connect Test and Monitor on cloud, as well as links to our community and blog. It's also where you can log on or, if you don't have a subscription yet, where you can sign up.

It is a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website, which we generate from the source code held in this GitHub repository, and publish to https://ibm-apiconnect.github.io/test-and-monitor/.

## Desktop Application Releases

The Desktop Application is a native application that allows you to perform many of the operations provided by the HTTP Client that's part of the cloud offering. Currently supported platforms are Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

You can download the latest version of the destkop HTTP client from the Developer Hub home page, and previous releases are held in this GitHub repository at https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/test-and-monitor/releases.

The images we publish for each release are :

- Linux: `apic-test-and-monitor.AppImage`
- MacOS: `apic-test-and-monitor.dmg`
- Windows: `apic-test-and-monitor.exe`

You'll also see the following files :

- `Source code (zip)`
- `Source code (tar.gz)`

These contain Developer Hub source code. They do **not** contain product code.

## Licencing

The Desktop Application is released under [International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/displaylis/2AEEA753FB4341FE852583CC00582B06?OpenDocument).
